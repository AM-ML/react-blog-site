                            "text": "This issue can be explained by going deeper into the structure of the Lebanese families. The Lebanese house-holds expenditure constitutes of 68 % spent for clothing, food, transportation, housing, and education, out of which education makes 5% of the total household average expenditure. Moreover, it is realized that the unemployment rate for the Lebanese youth is 47% in 2022, while for the adults it's the half approximately, and the unemployment rates decreases as age of worker increases. Taking this into consideration, the youth has always had only 2 choices for survival, either surrender or immigration. The households always prefer to backup this plan by educating their children so they increase their opportunities of immigration. As a Lebanese youth, you either surrender to a certain political party and sell yourself for them as an ambassador, organizer, and an active member in their party in return of having a job in the Lebanese government or having contracts, bids, bonds with the government, or depositing money in banks and getting more than 14 % interest and many other facilities, or you simply immigrate and search for a job and a settlement in any foreign country. Unfortunately, Lebanon does not export anything rather than human-beings, that send back dollars and foreign currencies into the Lebanese economy which constitutes of a major part of this corrupt economy."

This explains why the majority of educational staffs in Lebanon are of the feminine gender, since it is more preferable in the Lebanese mindsets to get tutored and educated by females."

This regime was so cunning and smart and was always able to hide behind, creating conspiracy theories to keep the Lebanese citizens attention away from the main problem. This regime doesn't give the Lebanese women their right to have a civil registry, but instead each Lebanese women is registered on her father's registration and then on her husband's civil record. This explain one extremist example: many Lebanese households see their daughters as products that will be transported to another household, her husband, and that she is of no main value, since any achievement that she will achieve will be recorded in her husband's credit, thus serving into depriving them from inheritance or other lawful shares. This issue can be solved by having periodic census of the Lebanese population, which will allow women to be registered on the civil record they decide. It is not a coincidence that this regime is still using the French census that was conducted in 1932., for this census conflicts with their sectarian existence. This sectarian regime does not see its citizens as people with rights, but as votes when election happens, and as sects in other periods. Having a civil state in Lebanon, as the law states, can resolve many problems, which feminist problems are part of them. In addition, upon a request of the Lebanese government, a study from the world bank deduced that the Syrian refugees’ conflict in Lebanon will create a 40% increase in the labor force, thus a 16% decrease in wages, 60-200% increase in immigration rate, 3% decrease in GDP per capita, and an increase of taxation. Those numbers were proved right from 2013 till 2022, and this is to be added to major problems that Lebanese workers suffer from, thus eliminating more the possibility of the resolving of women in labor market suffering."

Besides, although the Lebanese law protects against domestic violence, in most cases, domestic violence is not displayed in court, thus, this law is meaningless. This violence is always justified by the abusers, since the regime in Lebanon does not see citizens as people with rights, but rather as sects, thus strengthening the mindset of papal authority."

This treaty was just a kind of protocol for it leaves many deficiencies since it has many exceptions, such as workers in agriculture, domestic workers, workers in public sector, and workers in small family productions. Another deficiency is in the treaty of international labor 1987 since the government have signed and agreed on all of its points except the second point which indicates that workers have the right to make syndicates. This also leaves us to observe the miserable condition of syndicates in Lebanon, since syndicates can be a major threat for the sectarian regime. Syndicates reallocate people from being in sects to being as workers and social levels, and that is why there isn't a party of labor in Lebanon, but parties each representing a sect, a party that is unable to take any decision since any decision will benefit one social level and disadvantage another, since a sect is a sect for all social levels, unlike labor parties, and syndicates. To initiate a syndicate, you have to give the names of all members to the government, which puts any dynamic member in danger from being fired from his job if he was an active policy influencer in a certain syndicate. Hence, demanding special laws to protect against domestic violence will continue to classify women as peripheral, and continue to vague the main problem in Lebanon since the main issue that women in labor suffer from, is the same issue that all workers in Lebanese market suffer from which is the sectarian regime."

Chavez created a new economy which is totally dependent on oil prices. For his luck and fortune, during his presidency (1999-2013), oil prices were convenient to appear as a savior. After his presidency ended, a new president, Maduro, was elected, and due to the world economy fluctuation at that period, oil prices fell down in 2014. After peaking at $107.95 a barrel on June 20, 2014, petroleum prices plunged to $44.08 a barrel by January 28, 2015, a drop of 59.2 percent in a little over 7 months. Thanks to Chavez, the Venezuelan economy is now correlated to the oil market, and with failure of Maduro to adjust , hyperinflation occurred, and the crisis of the Venezuelan economy starts now!"

Moreover, Maduro has given the military a privilege to import food supply of the country on his rate, and due to the corruption that Maduro created to keep him in power, the military forces sold those supplies at the black-market rates, making a fortune! Maduro’s allies and military cabinet made massive profits, which have set very good relations with Maduro, thus, keeping Maduro in power. A study in 2016, shows that more than 80% of the citizens demand Maduro out of the office of presidency, thus, the series of protests starts in Venezuela."

Many revolutions initiated and spread around the country, but Maduro’s military allies hit with his fist of steel.

On the other hand, the Lebanese economy does not suffer from any sanctions, but it did get affected somehow by the fluctuation of oil prices. So we can see that the money supply in BDL was 20000 billion dollars in 2007, and it increased to reach 30000 billion dollars in 2009, after an increase in oil prices in this interval of time. However, this happened due to banking services that are performed by the Lebanese sectors but not a productive one or a sustainable one, or a sector that can hold by own an entire economy without having strict regulations. The entire money supply in Lebanon was found by debt, and that is why we saw a prospering economy in the 90s after Paris 1 conference, by which the Lebanese government borrowed more than 10 billion dollars, and then increasing this debt so much. However, after 2010, Lebanon did not find any side willing to borrow him more money so it sold bonds to local banks in hope that they pay them back by borrowing from the IMF , this is what is called a Ponzi scheme!"
