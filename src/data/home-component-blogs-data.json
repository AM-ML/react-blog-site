However, as of mid-December, Israel’s only Red Sea Port, at Eilat, reported an 85 percent drop in activity since the attacks began (Aljazeera, 2024). Based on a rapid assessment published by UNCTAD in February 2024, monthly transits dropped by around 50% in the Panama Canal and 42% in the Suez Canal."

The Gulf of Eden experienced a 70% decline in ship tonnage between December 2023 and February 2024, while vessel tonnage passing through the Cape of Good Hope increased by 60%, with 621 container ships rerouting."

With already existing shifts in the path of trade, maritime cargo travels have increased due to global trade shifts and globalization trends, with the Red Sea conflict and Ukraine war exacerbated. Grain to Egypt now comes from Brazil or the US, while Russian oil shipments go to India and China. Since the Suez Canal path cuts around 40% of the distance along the Cape of Good Hope, several rerouting effects have been displayed. To explain, increased distances in shipping markets lead to increased ton-mile demand, such as container shipping, oil tanker rerouting, and liquified natural gas-carrying vessels diverting away from the Suez Canal. Bulk trade has limited market impacts, but bulker ship capacity has been diverted. Grain and soybean flows have been affected, and the number of specialized car-carrying ships using the Red Sea has been cut by over half. Vessel prices and charter rates have also increased since December 2023."

Container shipping disruptions pose a threat to global supply chains, potentially leading to delayed deliveries, increased costs, and inflation. Current container freight rates are half the peak recorded during the COVID crisis, but sustained increases can drive up inflation. The crisis is also affecting global food prices, with disruptions in grain shipments from Russia, Ukraine, and Europe affecting consumers and lowering producer prices. The war in Ukraine has already shown the impact of longer distances and freight rates on food prices. Inflation rates in Europe reached a peak in October 2023, and interest rates have been increasing to combat inflation."
